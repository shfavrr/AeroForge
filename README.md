# AeroForge

A blockchain-powered platform for the aerospace and aviation industry that secures maintenance records, prevents parts forgery, enables fractional ownership of assets, and facilitates crowdfunding for space missions — all on-chain, leveraging immutable ledgers to enhance safety, transparency, and accessibility.

---

## Overview

AeroForge consists of five main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, secure, and collaborative ecosystem for aircraft operators, manufacturers, investors, and space enthusiasts:

1. **Maintenance Log Contract** – Manages immutable records of aircraft maintenance and inspections.
2. **Parts Certification NFT Contract** – Issues NFTs for verifiable aircraft parts certification to combat forgery.
3. **Fractional Ownership Token Contract** – Handles tokenized shares in aircraft or satellite assets for democratized investment.
4. **Crowdfunding DAO Contract** – Enables community-driven funding and governance for aerospace projects like space missions.
5. **Oracle Integration Contract** – Connects with off-chain data sources for real-time verification and air traffic safety protocols.

## Features

- **Immutable maintenance logs** with timestamped audits for regulatory compliance  
- **NFT-based parts certification** to ensure authenticity and reduce counterfeit risks  
- **Tokenized fractional ownership** lowering barriers for investing in high-value aerospace assets  
- **DAO crowdfunding** for space missions with transparent fund allocation and voter rewards  
- **Oracle-fed data sharing** for decentralized air traffic management and safety enhancements

## Smart Contracts

### Maintenance Log Contract
- Logs maintenance events with immutable timestamps and details
- Access controls for authorized personnel (e.g., mechanics, inspectors)
- Query functions for audit trails and compliance reporting

### Parts Certification NFT Contract
- Mints NFTs representing certified aircraft parts with metadata (serial numbers, origins)
- Transfer and verification mechanisms to track part lifecycle
- Royalty enforcement for manufacturers on resales

### Fractional Ownership Token Contract
- Issues fungible tokens representing shares in aircraft or satellites
- Staking for dividends from asset usage (e.g., leasing revenue)
- Redemption and transfer rules with KYC integration hooks

### Crowdfunding DAO Contract
- Proposal creation and voting for funding space missions or R&D
- Token-weighted governance with quorum requirements
- Automated fund disbursement upon successful votes

### Oracle Integration Contract
- Secure feeds from external sources (e.g., FAA data, satellite telemetry)
- Triggers updates to maintenance logs or ownership dividends
- Verification of air traffic data for decentralized safety protocols
